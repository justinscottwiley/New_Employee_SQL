# New_Employee_SQL

This is a new emplyoee SQL files to show how I created 6 tables to them import data to those tables. The two files show how it was created then the second code file shows the eight questions asked as practice for this project. A txt file was given to show my work on how I created my map for pgadmin. Also a png file with an image of my DBD diagram was presented to show the map. 

Visual stupid code, pgadmin, quickDBD were used to complete the work.
